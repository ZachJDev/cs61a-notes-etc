# cs61a-notes-etc
A repo for my notes as I work through cs61a and SICP (and some other related stuff)

All notes are in Markdown, and are set up for use in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault. Most of the coding I do for the class and book is in Dr. Racket, and you should be able to run the .rkt files from there. Some (though not all) are valid Scheme programs and may work with a Scheme interpreter.

Course info can be found at https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/ and all the lectures are on Internet Archive.
