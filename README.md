# cs61a-notes-etc
A repo for my notes as I work through cs61a and SICP (and some other related stuff)

All notes are in Markdown, and are set up for use in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault. Most of the coding I do for the class and book is in Dr. Racket, but those files are mostly unreadable in a different environment. The .scm files contain plain-text representations of the code, but will NOT run correctly outside of Dr. Racket.

Course info can be found at https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/ and the lectures are on Internet Archive.
