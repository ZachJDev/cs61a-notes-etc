This and the next lecture are video recordings of Alan Kay talking about UI (?) Design. 

A better  version is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZdxiQoOBgs

I'll watch that and put all notes here.

1987 -- so ~35 years ago.

"Doing with Images Makes Symbols: Communicating with Computers"

The UI of a OS does something similiar to what the OS does to the bare machine: tries to turn it into something more understandable.

['Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad)' first program with a window. also a touchscreen-like system.

Douglas Englebardt -- invetor of the mouse and envisoner of the future. person-to-person communication.

clipping divider, multiple windows, virtual displays -- the thing that AK first worked on.

A lot more touchpad-like interaction than I  realzed. 

RAND tablet and GRAIL -- iconic programming -- seems to literally draw programs.

Annologic commands -- Do you want a box? draw a box. Do you want an 's'? draw an 's'.
- can always be looking at the screen.

"I don't know who discovered water, but it wasn't a fish" -- if you're immersed in a context, it's hard to see what it is.
