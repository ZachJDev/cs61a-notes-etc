 - 'The best CS class in the world' 
-	they are using something called 'STK', but i'll use Dr. Racket
-	Infix notation (3 + 4), vs. Prefix notation (Sin pi/2) vs. postfix notation (7!) and 'wrap-around' notation (sqrt(25) (but imagine it's the real sqrt sign...)). These are all used in the math notation we' learn in school. It's not uniform, and they don't work well with more than two operands. Scheme uses prefix notation for everything (but actually Polish notation)
-	composition of functions: the ability to pass the results of one function as the input to another. "It turns out to be so useful for organizing computations that it is basically all we need."
-	STK seems to have some more language features than the SICP-specific Scheme implementation that I'm using. Ended up using Simply-Scheme, which also has those features.
-	'define' expressions are 'special forms' -- it does not follow the standard order of procedures. 'if' expressions are too -- we only evaluate one of the second and third arguments.
-	[[Programming Langauges]] - Logo ?? never heard of it. But apparently we'll be writing a logo interpreter at the end of the 'semester'
