It is theoretically impossible to have a better sorting algorithm than theta(n log n) in cases where you are comparing two values (e.g., I think radix sort is faster and doesn't depend on comparisons).

Moral of this entire lecture: think hard about what's making your algorithm ineffienct, and work to improve the order of growth, not just fine-tuning a bad algorithm.
