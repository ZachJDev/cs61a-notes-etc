Yay, the midterm has a room assignment!

Efficiency. Today is time, next lecture is space.

How do we measure time efficiency? 

Not with a stopwatch -- not all computers are the same and an old computer or a computer running a lot of processes will not run any algorithm as quick as a new, lean computer.

We ask: "how many constant-time operations take place?"

Always keep the domain and range in mind when creating algorithms and procedures.

cosntant factors aren't interesting and we can safely ignore them when determining running time. -- Any factor will always be exactly the same size, no matter how big or small the input is.

oohhh, Brian Harvey is calling out how I learned big-O. The notation most of us use is incorrect and doesn't *really* explain what's happening. But the notation has some Set theory symbols I don't know how to type.
